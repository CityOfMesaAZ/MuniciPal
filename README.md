# Prerequisites

* This application requires Rails.
* This application also requires Postgres SQL. If you don't have it, [download and install here](http://postgresapp.com/).

# Installation instructions

#### Clone the app to your machine:

    git clone
    cd MuniciPal

*If you want to update or change these specific shapefiles, they exist in the lib/asset folder in the application.*

#### Run your application

    rails server

#### Troubleshooting

Make sure the postgis extension is properly loaded.

    SELECT POSTGIS_VERSION(); # succeeds if PostGIS objects are present.
